# DWL-retrieval
This repository contains the code to calculate 10 minutes mean wind and wind 
gust peaks from daily Doppler wind lidar files (netcdfs in SAMD convention) 
as described in

A new scanning scheme and flexible retrieval to derive both mean winds and
gusts from Doppler lidar measurements, Atmos. Meas. Tech

**How to use**:
Download the data set related to the paper. Run the _main.py_ to reproduce the 
level2 gust files or modify for other lidar data. The functions that calculate
the outcomes are contained in _DWL_retrieval.py_

Two example days are given:
- The 29th September 2019 in a 24Beam configuration (due to size reasons). 
  _/data_ provides the level1 data and main_testday calculates level2 gust 
  (and 600s, and circ) outcomes for the day
- The 29th June 2021 in quck continuous scanning mode (too big for git, so

  _/data_ provides the level1 data and main_testday_qCSM calculates level2 gust 
  (and 600s, and circ) outcomes for the day with included correction of w
